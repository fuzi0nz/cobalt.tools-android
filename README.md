  <p>Cobalt.Tools PWA for android.</p>
I am not a developer I just wanted a simple way to use cobalt.tools on my android device. If you'd like to contribute or take over the project let me know as this is not my expertise. I'll try to provide all the necessary files Im just not sure what I'm doing lol, please help ðŸ¤£ One feature I'd really like to be able to add is deeplinking so you can share straight from the social media app to cobalt.tools app on device.
